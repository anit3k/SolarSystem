                        <h3>The Sun</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="detail-text"><p> Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. 
                        The Sun is about 150 million kilometers from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.</p>
                        <p>
                        The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. 
                        Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. 
                        The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 15 million degrees Celsius. 
                        The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, 
                        influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.</p>
                    
                        <p> NASA and other international space agencies monitor the Sun 24/7 with a fleet of spacecraft, 
                        studying everything from its atmosphere to its surface, and even peering inside the Sun using special instruments. 
                        Sun-exploring spacecraft include Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, ACE, IRIS, WIND, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory, 
                        and STEREO.</p>

                    <p>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system.<br>
                        Over one million Earth's could fit inside the Sun.<br>
                        One day the Sun will consume the Earth.<br>
                        The energy created by the Sun's core is nuclear fusion.<br>
                        The Sun is almost a perfect sphere.<br>
                        The Sun is travelling at 220 km per second.</p>
