Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a donut-shaped region of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. 
There may be millions of these icy objects, 
collectively referred to as Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), in this distant region of our solar system.

Pluto – which is smaller than Earth’s Moon – has a heart-shaped glacier that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma. 
This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows – but the snow is red.

On July 14, 2015, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft made its historic flight through the Pluto system – providing the first close-up images of 
Pluto and its moons and collecting other data that has transformed our understanding of 
these mysterious worlds on the solar system’s outer frontier.

In the years since that groundbreaking flyby, 
nearly every conjecture about Pluto possibly being an inert ball of ice has been thrown out the window or flipped on its head.

“It’s clear to me that the solar system saved the best for last!” said Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator from 
the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado. 
“We could not have explored a more fascinating or scientifically important planet at the edge of our solar system. 
The New Horizons team worked for 15 years to plan and execute this flyby and Pluto paid us back in spades!”
