Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system.
It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.
Uranus is very cold and windy.
The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.
This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.
