Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density.
Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat.
It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
Surface temperatures on Venus are about 475°C
Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.
Another big difference from Earth – Venus rotates on its axis backward, compared to most of the other planets in the solar system.
Venus was the first planet to be explored by a spacecraft.
