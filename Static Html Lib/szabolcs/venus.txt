Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.
It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density.
Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat.
